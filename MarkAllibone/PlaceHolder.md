## Writing Reactive .NET MAUI apps

Reactive programming allows you to write event-driven code. When we think about a mobile app, we can see a lot of interactions are driven by events. The user pushes a button, navigates to or from a page, a background service fires an event due to updated data, the user types into a form and we show suggestions. So let's dive into this event-driven world and have a look at how to write real-world reactive mobile apps using Reactive UI and friends that your users will love.
